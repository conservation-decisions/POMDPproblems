Description form the paper:
"We illustrate the benefits of using alpha-min to best manage
or monitor four sub-populations of Sumatran tigers with 
declining connectivity over a 10-year time horizon [Linkie et
al., 2006]. We model this problem as a non-stationary finitehorizon
POMDP with 16 states representing the status extinct
or extant of each sub-population; 13 actions representing the
decisions of doing nothing, managing and/or monitoring each
sub-population; 16 observations representing the difficulty of
detecting Sumatran tigers in each sub-population (absent or
present); and 10 transition matrices representing the declining
connectivity between subpopulations over time. The probabilities
of going extinct with and without management were
derived based on tiger census estimates [Chad`es et al., 2008;
Linkie et al., 2006]. Detection probabilities were derived
based on [McDonald-Madden et al., 2011], and projected
fragmentation scenarios followed [Linkie et al., 2006]. Interested

POMDPs in conservation problems."
