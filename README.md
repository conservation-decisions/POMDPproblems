Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a convenient mathematical model to solve sequential decision-making problems under imperfect observations. The POMDPproblems repository aim to provide examples of POMDP problems published or unpublished in ecology, conservation, biosecurity, and health (list to be completed). 


At the moment we are limiting our repository to the following file format: Tony's pomdp format (.pomdp), SPUDD-SymbolicPerseus factored representation (.txt) and XML SARSOP (.pomdpx).

If you wish to contribute to this repository please follow these steps:
1. Insure the POMDP problem can be shared (license, approval, acknowledgments etc);
2. Please describe the problem and reference to published literature;
3. Submit contribution; 

The submission will be tested on one of the following solvers:
- pomdp-solve http://www.pomdp.org/code/
- perseus http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/mtjspaan/software/
- symbolic perseus https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ppoupart/software.html
- SARSOP https://github.com/AdaCompNUS/sarsop
